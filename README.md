# COMP410-AutomatedTesting
This is an Automated Testing approach implemented in Prolog for JavaScript.

### How to use:
Load entry_point.pl into swipl
Type the query "program(Bound)" where Bound is the depth of the ast. 
*Note: Nothing will be printed on the cnosole.
The sole output will be a file.txt file in the same directory. It will list all the expressions generated by the program.

Similarly, loading prettyPrint2, and querying program(Bound) would generate a file called "printer.js" which will contain a limited subset of definition being printed in actual js.
