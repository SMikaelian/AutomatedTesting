Load entry_point.pl into swipl, and then type the query "program(Bound)" where Bound is the depth of the ast. Nothing will be printed on the cnosole, 
the sole output will be a file.txt file in the same directory. It will list all the program generated by the program. 
Similarly, laoding prettyPrint2, and querying program(Bound) would generate a file called "printer.js" which will contain a limited subset of definition being printed in 
actual js.
